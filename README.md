# Bitcoin Trading
My goal here is to create a program that analyzes the outcomes of a large number of past bitcoin (or any other asset) trades. I'm hoping this will be valuable for developing insights on the efficacy of certain trading strategies, hopefully allowing me to eventually create a trading strategy of my own as a biproduct of this program.
